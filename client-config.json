IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.<\/strong>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>12.1\tSummary<\/strong>.\r\n<div>\r\n<strong>In the unlikely event that NWSN is unable to resolve any complaint You may have to Your satisfaction related hereto (or if NWSN has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction.<\/strong> Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. <strong>Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.<\/strong> For any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $75,000, NWSN will pay all costs of the arbitration. Moreover, in arbitration you are entitled to recover attorneys\u2019 fees from NWSN to at least the same extent as you would be in court.\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\nIn addition, under certain circumstances (as explained below), NWSN will pay You more than the amount of the arbitrator\u2019s award and will pay Your attorney (if any) twice his or her reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees if the arbitrator awards you an amount that is greater than what NWSN has offered you to settle the dispute.\r\n<\/div>\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>12.2\tArbitration Agreement<\/strong>.\r\n<div>\r\n(1) NWSN and You agree to arbitrate <strong>all disputes and claims<\/strong> between us. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to:\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;<\/li>\r\n\t<li>claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);<\/li>\r\n\t<li>claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which You are not a member of a certified class; and<\/li>\r\n\t<li>claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\nFor purposes of this Section 12, references to \u201C NWSN,\u201D \u201CYou(r),\u201D and \u201CUs\u201D include our respective subsidiaries, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or Devices under this or prior Agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individualized action in small claims court. This arbitration agreement does not preclude You from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, including, for example, the Federal Communications Commission. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on Your behalf. <strong>You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, You and<\/strong> NWSN <strong>are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action<\/strong>. This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n(2) A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (\u201CNotice\u201D). The Notice to NWSN should be addressed toNW SportsNet LLC, 3626 156th Avenue SE, Bellevue, WA 98006, with a cc to Legal Department, AT&amp;T Sports Networks, LLC 601 Union St., Suite 3020, Seattle, WA 98101 (\u201CNotice Addresses\u201D). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (\u201CDemand\u201D). If NWSN and You do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, You or NWSN may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by NWSN or You shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which You or NWSN is entitled. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n(3) After You have commenced arbitration, NWSN will promptly reimburse You for Your payment of the filing fee, unless Your claim is for greater than $75,000. (The filing fee currently is $200 for claims under $10,000 but is subject to change by the arbitration provider. If You are unable to pay this fee, NWSN will pay it directly upon receiving a written request at the Notice Address.) The arbitration will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules (\u201CAAA Rules\u201D) of the American Arbitration Association (\u201CAAA\u201D), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. If the AAA is unavailable, the parties shall agree to another arbitration provider or the court shall appoint a substitute. The AAA Rules are available online at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adr.org\/\">adr.org<\/a>, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for the court to decide. Unless NWSN and You agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of Your billing address. If Your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that You may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If Your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. Except as otherwise provided for herein, NWSN will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of Your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, You agree to reimburse NWSN for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise Your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. In addition, if You initiate an arbitration in which You seek more than $75,000 in damages, the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n(4) If, after finding in your favor in any respect on the merits of your claim, the arbitrator issues You an award that is greater than the value of NWSN\u2019 last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected, then NWSN will:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>pay You the amount of the award or $10,000 (\u201Cthe alternative payment\u201D), whichever is greater; and<\/li>\r\n\t<li>pay Your attorney, if any, twice the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees, and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that Your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing Your claim in arbitration (\u201Cthe attorney premium\u201D).<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nIf NWSN did not make a written offer to settle the dispute before an arbitrator was selected, You and Your attorney will be entitled to receive the alternative payment and the attorney premium, respectively, if the arbitrator awards You any relief on the merits. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the attorney premium at any time during the proceedings and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator\u2019s ruling on the merits. \r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n(5) The right to attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses discussed in paragraph (4) supplements any right to attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses You may have under applicable law. Thus, if You would be entitled to a larger amount under the applicable law, this provision does not preclude the arbitrator from awarding You that amount. However, You may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys\u2019 fees or costs. Although under some laws NWSN may have a right to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses if it prevails in an arbitration, NWSN agrees that it will not seek such an award.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n(6) The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party\u2019s individual claim. <strong>YOU AND NWSN AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING<\/strong>. Further, unless both You and NWSN agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph\u2019s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from arbitration and may be brought in court.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n(7) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if NWSN makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address) during Your Service Commitment, You may reject any such change by sending Us written notice within 30 days of the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, You are agreeing that You will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision.\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>13.\tDISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES<\/strong>.\r\n<div>\r\nYOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE APP AND SERVICE, INCLUDING ALL CONTENT CONTAINED THEREIN OR ACCESSED THEREBY, ARE PROVIDED ON AN \u201CAS IS\u2019 AND \u201CAS AVAILABLE\u201D BASIS, AND THAT YOUR USE OF OR RELIANCE UPON THE APP AND SERVICE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND DISCRETION.

If you would like access to our award-winning live game coverage and streaming services contact your virtual TV provider and ask that they carry ROOT SPORTS. <\/p>\r\n\r\n <h3> How do I sign into the streaming service on the web platform or mobile app? <\/h3>\r\n <p>Log-on to the web platform by clicking on the WATCH button on our website or downloading the mobile app. When prompted, select your TV provider from the list, and input your username and password (same log-on you use to view and pay your bill online).

If none of these restrictions exist, please check other technical and authentication issues above.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2> App Use Section<\/h2>\r\n <h3> Is there a way to stop, pause and or record the live games? <\/h3>\r\n <p>Our app will allow you to pause and stop live games, but not to record or download for offline viewing as part of this service. <\/p>\r\n\r\n <h3> What data does ROOT SPORTS collect?<\/h3>\r\n <p>We confirm your TV subscription and use your location in order to verify that you are within our geographic footprint and qualify for viewing of the content provided.

IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.<\/strong>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>12.1\tSummary<\/strong>.\r\n<div>\r\nMost customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer\u2019s satisfaction by reaching our customer service department by going to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.attsportsnet.com\/contact-us\/\">http:\/\/www.attsportsnet.com\/contact-us\/<\/a> and submitting issues. <strong>In the unlikely event that AT&T Sports Networks customer service department is unable to resolve a complaint You may have to Your satisfaction (or if AT&T Sports Networks has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction<\/strong>. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. <strong>Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted<\/strong>. For any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $75,000, AT&T Sports Networks\u2019 will pay all costs of the arbitration. Moreover, in arbitration you are entitled to recover attorneys\u2019 fees from AT&T Sports Networks to at least the same extent as you would be in court.\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\nIn addition, under certain circumstances (as explained below), AT&T Sports Networks will pay You more than the amount of the arbitrator\u2019s award and will pay Your attorney (if any) twice his or her reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees if the arbitrator awards you an amount that is greater than what NWSN has offered you to settle the dispute.\r\n<\/div>\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>12.2\tArbitration Agreement<\/strong>.\r\n<div>\r\n(1) AT&T Sports Networks and You agree to arbitrate <strong>all disputes and claims<\/strong> between us. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to:\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;<\/li>\r\n\t<li>claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);<\/li>\r\n\t<li>claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which You are not a member of a certified class; and<\/li>\r\n\t<li>claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\nFor purposes of this Section 12, references to \u201CAT&T Sports Networks,\u201D \u201CYou(r),\u201D and \u201CUs\u201D include our respective subsidiaries, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or Devices under this or prior Agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individualized action in small claims court. This arbitration agreement does not preclude You from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, including, for example, the Federal Communications Commission. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on Your behalf. <strong>You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, You and<\/strong> AT&T Sports Networks <strong>are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action<\/strong>. This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n(2) A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (\u201CNotice\u201D). The Notice to AT&T Sports Networks should be addressed to both the Legal Department and to the Office of Programming at: AT&T Sports Networks LLC, 601 Union St., Suite 3020, Seattle, WA 98101 (\u201CNotice Address\u201D). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (\u201CDemand\u201D). If AT&T Sports Networks and You do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, You or AT&T Sports Networks may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by AT&T Sports Networks or You shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which You or AT&T Sports Networks is entitled. You may download or copy a form Notice and a form to initiate arbitration at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.att.com\/arbitration-forms\">att.com\/arbitration-forms<\/a>. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n(3) After You have commenced arbitration, AT&T Sports Networks will promptly reimburse You for Your payment of the filing fee, unless Your claim is for greater than $75,000. (The filing fee currently is $200 for claims under $10,000 but is subject to change by the arbitration provider. If You are unable to pay this fee, AT&T Sports Networks will pay it directly upon receiving a written request at the Notice Address.) The arbitration will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules (\u201CAAA Rules\u201D) of the American Arbitration Association (\u201CAAA\u201D), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. If the AAA is unavailable, the parties shall agree to another arbitration provider or the court shall appoint a substitute. The AAA Rules are available online at <a href=\"\">adr.org<\/a>, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address. (You may obtain information that is designed for non-lawyers about the arbitration process at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.att.com\/arbitration-forms\">att.com\/arbitration-forms<\/a>.) The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for the court to decide. Unless AT&T Sports Networks and You agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of Your billing address. If Your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that You may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If Your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. Except as otherwise provided for herein, AT&T Sports Networks will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of Your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, You agree to reimburse AT&T Sports Networks for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise Your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. In addition, if You initiate an arbitration in which You seek more than $75,000 in damages, the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n(4) If, after finding in your favor in any respect on the merits of your claim, the arbitrator issues You an award that is greater than the value of AT&T Sports Networks\u2019  last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected, then AT&T Sports Networks will:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>pay You the amount of the award or $10,000 (\u201Cthe alternative payment\u201D), whichever is greater; and<\/li>\r\n\t<li>pay Your attorney, if any, twice the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees, and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that Your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing Your claim in arbitration (\u201Cthe attorney premium\u201D).<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nIf AT&T Sports Networks did not make a written offer to settle the dispute before an arbitrator was selected, You and Your attorney will be entitled to receive the alternative payment and the attorney premium, respectively, if the arbitrator awards You any relief on the merits. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the attorney premium at any time during the proceedings and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator\u2019s ruling on the merits. \r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n(5) The right to attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses discussed in paragraph (4) supplements any right to attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses You may have under applicable law. Thus, if You would be entitled to a larger amount under the applicable law, this provision does not preclude the arbitrator from awarding You that amount. However, You may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys\u2019 fees or costs. Although under some laws AT&T Sports Networks may have a right to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses if it prevails in an arbitration, AT&T Sports Networks agrees that it will not seek such an award.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n(6) The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party\u2019s individual claim. <strong>YOU AND AT&T Sports Networks AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING<\/strong>. Further, unless both You and AT&T Sports Networks agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph\u2019s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from arbitration and may be brought in court.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n(7) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if AT&T Sports Networks makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address) during Your Service Commitment, You may reject any such change by sending Us written notice within 30 days of the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, You are agreeing that You will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision.\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>13.\tDISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES<\/strong>.\r\n<div>\r\nYOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE APP AND SERVICE, INCLUDING ALL CONTENT CONTAINED THEREIN OR ACCESSED THEREBY, ARE PROVIDED ON AN \u201CAS IS\u2019 AND \u201CAS AVAILABLE\u201D BASIS, AND THAT YOUR USE OF OR RELIANCE UPON THE APP AND SERVICE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND DISCRETION.

IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.<\/strong>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>12.1\tSummary<\/strong>.\r\n<div>\r\nMost customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer\u2019s satisfaction by reaching our customer service department by going to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.attsportsnet.com\/contact-us\/\">http:\/\/www.attsportsnet.com\/contact-us\/<\/a> and submitting issues. <strong>In the unlikely event that AT&T Sports Networks customer service department is unable to resolve a complaint You may have to Your satisfaction (or if AT&T Sports Networks has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction<\/strong>. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. <strong>Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted<\/strong>. For any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $75,000, AT&T Sports Networks\u2019 will pay all costs of the arbitration. Moreover, in arbitration you are entitled to recover attorneys\u2019 fees from AT&T Sports Networks to at least the same extent as you would be in court.\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\nIn addition, under certain circumstances (as explained below), AT&T Sports Networks will pay You more than the amount of the arbitrator\u2019s award and will pay Your attorney (if any) twice his or her reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees if the arbitrator awards you an amount that is greater than what NWSN has offered you to settle the dispute.\r\n<\/div>\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>12.2\tArbitration Agreement<\/strong>.\r\n<div>\r\n(1) AT&T Sports Networks and You agree to arbitrate <strong>all disputes and claims<\/strong> between us. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to:\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;<\/li>\r\n\t<li>claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);<\/li>\r\n\t<li>claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which You are not a member of a certified class; and<\/li>\r\n\t<li>claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\nFor purposes of this Section 12, references to \u201CAT&T Sports Networks,\u201D \u201CYou(r),\u201D and \u201CUs\u201D include our respective subsidiaries, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or Devices under this or prior Agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individualized action in small claims court. This arbitration agreement does not preclude You from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, including, for example, the Federal Communications Commission. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on Your behalf. <strong>You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, You and<\/strong> AT&T Sports Networks <strong>are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action<\/strong>. This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n(2) A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (\u201CNotice\u201D). The Notice to AT&T Sports Networks should be addressed to both the Legal Department and to the Office of Programming at: AT&T Sports Networks LLC, 601 Union St., Suite 3020, Seattle, WA 98101 (\u201CNotice Address\u201D). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (\u201CDemand\u201D). If AT&T Sports Networks and You do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, You or AT&T Sports Networks may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by AT&T Sports Networks or You shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which You or AT&T Sports Networks is entitled. You may download or copy a form Notice and a form to initiate arbitration at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.att.com\/arbitration-forms\">att.com\/arbitration-forms<\/a>. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n(3) After You have commenced arbitration, AT&T Sports Networks will promptly reimburse You for Your payment of the filing fee, unless Your claim is for greater than $75,000. (The filing fee currently is $200 for claims under $10,000 but is subject to change by the arbitration provider. If You are unable to pay this fee, AT&T Sports Networks will pay it directly upon receiving a written request at the Notice Address.) The arbitration will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules (\u201CAAA Rules\u201D) of the American Arbitration Association (\u201CAAA\u201D), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. If the AAA is unavailable, the parties shall agree to another arbitration provider or the court shall appoint a substitute. The AAA Rules are available online at <a href=\"\">adr.org<\/a>, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address. (You may obtain information that is designed for non-lawyers about the arbitration process at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.att.com\/arbitration-forms\">att.com\/arbitration-forms<\/a>.) The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for the court to decide. Unless AT&T Sports Networks and You agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of Your billing address. If Your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that You may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If Your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. Except as otherwise provided for herein, AT&T Sports Networks will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of Your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, You agree to reimburse AT&T Sports Networks for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise Your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. In addition, if You initiate an arbitration in which You seek more than $75,000 in damages, the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n(4) If, after finding in your favor in any respect on the merits of your claim, the arbitrator issues You an award that is greater than the value of AT&T Sports Networks\u2019  last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected, then AT&T Sports Networks will:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>pay You the amount of the award or $10,000 (\u201Cthe alternative payment\u201D), whichever is greater; and<\/li>\r\n\t<li>pay Your attorney, if any, twice the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees, and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that Your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing Your claim in arbitration (\u201Cthe attorney premium\u201D).<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nIf AT&T Sports Networks did not make a written offer to settle the dispute before an arbitrator was selected, You and Your attorney will be entitled to receive the alternative payment and the attorney premium, respectively, if the arbitrator awards You any relief on the merits. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the attorney premium at any time during the proceedings and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator\u2019s ruling on the merits. \r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n(5) The right to attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses discussed in paragraph (4) supplements any right to attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses You may have under applicable law. Thus, if You would be entitled to a larger amount under the applicable law, this provision does not preclude the arbitrator from awarding You that amount. However, You may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys\u2019 fees or costs. Although under some laws AT&T Sports Networks may have a right to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses if it prevails in an arbitration, AT&T Sports Networks agrees that it will not seek such an award.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n(6) The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party\u2019s individual claim. <strong>YOU AND AT&T Sports Networks AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING<\/strong>. Further, unless both You and AT&T Sports Networks agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph\u2019s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from arbitration and may be brought in court.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n(7) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if AT&T Sports Networks makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address) during Your Service Commitment, You may reject any such change by sending Us written notice within 30 days of the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, You are agreeing that You will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision.\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>13.\tDISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES<\/strong>.\r\n<div>\r\nYOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE APP AND SERVICE, INCLUDING ALL CONTENT CONTAINED THEREIN OR ACCESSED THEREBY, ARE PROVIDED ON AN \u201CAS IS\u2019 AND \u201CAS AVAILABLE\u201D BASIS, AND THAT YOUR USE OF OR RELIANCE UPON THE APP AND SERVICE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND DISCRETION.

IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.<\/strong>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>12.1\tSummary<\/strong>.\r\n<div>\r\nMost customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer\u2019s satisfaction by reaching our customer service department by going to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.attsportsnet.com\/contact-us\/\">http:\/\/www.attsportsnet.com\/contact-us\/<\/a> and submitting issues. <strong>In the unlikely event that AT&T Sports Networks customer service department is unable to resolve a complaint You may have to Your satisfaction (or if AT&T Sports Networks has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction<\/strong>. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. <strong>Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted<\/strong>. For any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $75,000, AT&T Sports Networks\u2019 will pay all costs of the arbitration. Moreover, in arbitration you are entitled to recover attorneys\u2019 fees from AT&T Sports Networks to at least the same extent as you would be in court.\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\nIn addition, under certain circumstances (as explained below), AT&T Sports Networks will pay You more than the amount of the arbitrator\u2019s award and will pay Your attorney (if any) twice his or her reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees if the arbitrator awards you an amount that is greater than what NWSN has offered you to settle the dispute.\r\n<\/div>\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>12.2\tArbitration Agreement<\/strong>.\r\n<div>\r\n(1) AT&T Sports Networks and You agree to arbitrate <strong>all disputes and claims<\/strong> between us. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to:\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;<\/li>\r\n\t<li>claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);<\/li>\r\n\t<li>claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which You are not a member of a certified class; and<\/li>\r\n\t<li>claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\nFor purposes of this Section 12, references to \u201CAT&T Sports Networks,\u201D \u201CYou(r),\u201D and \u201CUs\u201D include our respective subsidiaries, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or Devices under this or prior Agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individualized action in small claims court. This arbitration agreement does not preclude You from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, including, for example, the Federal Communications Commission. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on Your behalf. <strong>You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, You and<\/strong> AT&T Sports Networks <strong>are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action<\/strong>. This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n(2) A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (\u201CNotice\u201D). The Notice to AT&T Sports Networks should be addressed to both the Legal Department and to the Office of Programming at: AT&T Sports Networks LLC, 601 Union St., Suite 3020, Seattle, WA 98101 (\u201CNotice Address\u201D). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (\u201CDemand\u201D). If AT&T Sports Networks and You do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, You or AT&T Sports Networks may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by AT&T Sports Networks or You shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which You or AT&T Sports Networks is entitled. You may download or copy a form Notice and a form to initiate arbitration at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.att.com\/arbitration-forms\">att.com\/arbitration-forms<\/a>. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n(3) After You have commenced arbitration, AT&T Sports Networks will promptly reimburse You for Your payment of the filing fee, unless Your claim is for greater than $75,000. (The filing fee currently is $200 for claims under $10,000 but is subject to change by the arbitration provider. If You are unable to pay this fee, AT&T Sports Networks will pay it directly upon receiving a written request at the Notice Address.) The arbitration will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules (\u201CAAA Rules\u201D) of the American Arbitration Association (\u201CAAA\u201D), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. If the AAA is unavailable, the parties shall agree to another arbitration provider or the court shall appoint a substitute. The AAA Rules are available online at <a href=\"\">adr.org<\/a>, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address. (You may obtain information that is designed for non-lawyers about the arbitration process at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.att.com\/arbitration-forms\">att.com\/arbitration-forms<\/a>.) The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for the court to decide. Unless AT&T Sports Networks and You agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of Your billing address. If Your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that You may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If Your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. Except as otherwise provided for herein, AT&T Sports Networks will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of Your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, You agree to reimburse AT&T Sports Networks for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise Your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. In addition, if You initiate an arbitration in which You seek more than $75,000 in damages, the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n(4) If, after finding in your favor in any respect on the merits of your claim, the arbitrator issues You an award that is greater than the value of AT&T Sports Networks\u2019  last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected, then AT&T Sports Networks will:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>pay You the amount of the award or $10,000 (\u201Cthe alternative payment\u201D), whichever is greater; and<\/li>\r\n\t<li>pay Your attorney, if any, twice the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees, and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that Your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing Your claim in arbitration (\u201Cthe attorney premium\u201D).<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nIf AT&T Sports Networks did not make a written offer to settle the dispute before an arbitrator was selected, You and Your attorney will be entitled to receive the alternative payment and the attorney premium, respectively, if the arbitrator awards You any relief on the merits. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the attorney premium at any time during the proceedings and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator\u2019s ruling on the merits. \r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n(5) The right to attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses discussed in paragraph (4) supplements any right to attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses You may have under applicable law. Thus, if You would be entitled to a larger amount under the applicable law, this provision does not preclude the arbitrator from awarding You that amount. However, You may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys\u2019 fees or costs. Although under some laws AT&T Sports Networks may have a right to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses if it prevails in an arbitration, AT&T Sports Networks agrees that it will not seek such an award.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n(6) The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party\u2019s individual claim. <strong>YOU AND AT&T Sports Networks AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING<\/strong>. Further, unless both You and AT&T Sports Networks agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph\u2019s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from arbitration and may be brought in court.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n(7) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if AT&T Sports Networks makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address) during Your Service Commitment, You may reject any such change by sending Us written notice within 30 days of the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above.
